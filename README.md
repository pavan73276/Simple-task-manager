# To-Do List Application

A simple and intuitive front-end application for managing personal tasks. This to-do list app allows users to add, edit, delete, and organize tasks stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring data persists between sessions.

## Overview

This project provides an easy-to-use task management tool where users can:
- Add new tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates, and priority levels.
- Mark tasks as complete.
- Filter tasks based on priority and status (completed, overdue, or upcoming).
- Edit and delete tasks directly from the task list.
- Store tasks locally, allowing data persistence without a backend.

Built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, this application focuses on functionality, simplicity, and responsive design.

Assumptions Made During Development
Local Storage as Primary Data Source:

Tasks are stored in the browserâ€™s local storage since there is no backend database.
Basic Task Attributes:

Each task includes a title, description, due date, priority level (High, Medium, Low), and completion status.
No Authentication:

Tasks are accessible only on the same device and browser.
Read-Only Task Display in Search/Filter View:

Task modification options (edit, delete, complete) are disabled in filtered or search mode for clarity.
Basic Styling with Tailwind CSS:

Tailwind CSS is used for a responsive, mobile-friendly design.
